1.1: Add 'sc' to Ettore's code
1) Def param of sc in param.F90 and allocate/deallocate them in initial_end.F90
2) Save cicj_sc_global (indeed the OBDM is the same with cicj_sc_global) and let Fpairing=BCS_sc 
3) BCAST Fpairing to all rank 

1.2: Use fake_BCS state to simulate the Green Function after CPMC calculation £¨more parameter than DET£©

1.2HF: Add HF to 1.2

1.2Analytic: Add allopen BC for 1 band model (a)

1.3: Add output of observables along every step and some control parameters at param.F90

1.4: Add tprime model

1.41: Add pinning-type

1.42: Add Random Matrix Green Function Modification

1.5: Add smarter decomposition method £¨haven't apply£©(understand error, useless) ---> 1.44 (BCS Green Function generator work)

1.5: correct B.C. for t_prime model

1.6: add GHF as an initial trial wave function option
Attention:
1) coupled form is forced into decoupled form at BCS part

1.61: allow dtype="couple" for pBCS (tring at 1.7)

1.7: start from 1.6 and add coupled form for BCS 
Attention: 
1)  the difference between A in Green and overlap 
2) the decoupled form is not checked
