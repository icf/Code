1.1: Add 'sc' to Ettore's code
1) Def param of sc in param.F90 and allocate/deallocate them in initial_end.F90
2) Save cicj_sc_global (indeed the OBDM is the same with cicj_sc_global) and let Fpairing=BCS_sc 
3) BCAST Fpairing to all rank 

1.2: Use fake_BCS state to simulate the Green Function after CPMC calculation £¨more parameter than DET£©

1.2HF: Add HF to 1.2

1.2Analytic: Add allopen BC for 1 band model (a)

1.3: Add output of observables along every step and some control parameters at param.F90

1.4: Add tprime model

1.41: Add pinning-type

1.42: Add Random Matrix Green Function Modification

1.5: Add smarter decomposition method £¨haven't apply£©(understand error, useless) ---> 1.44 (BCS Green Function generator work)

1.5: correct B.C. for t_prime model

1.6: add GHF as an initial trial wave function option
Attention:
1) coupled form is forced into decoupled form at BCS part

1.61: allow dtype="couple" for pBCS (trying at 1.7)

1.7: start from 1.6 and add coupled form for BCS 
Attention: 
1)  the difference between A in Green and overlap 
2) the decoupled form is not checked 

Error in Density
1) try to find the behavior of error in Analytic pBCS SC CPMC from 1.6
2) add VMpBCS and several tools to understand the error in pBCS CPMC

update Error in Density
1)correct the way to generate Density function in "cicj_sc_global_input_generator2"

2.0
add pBCS_phase and the following variational method

2.1
start with random phase and show the real_limit in LOG

2.2
add t_prime and pinnning

2.3
Add Min_cho (make sure mixed estimator variation is convinced with pure estimator one)
