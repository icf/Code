ITensor Library License - Version 1.2 - November 24th, 2014

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organization
obtaining a copy of the software and accompanying documentation covered by
this license (the "Library") to use, reproduce, display, distribute,
execute, and transmit the Library, and to prepare derivative works of the
Library, and to permit third-parties to whom the Library is furnished to
do so, all subject to the following:

1. In any scientific publication where significant published data was produced 
using the Library, use of the Library must be acknowledged and this acknowledgement 
must include the address of the ITensor website http://itensor.org/. 
The suggested format is: 
"Calculations performed using the ITensor C++ library (version X.X.X), http://itensor.org/"
where X.X.X should be replaced with the actual version number used.
The version number is optional, but could be useful for groups wishing to share their code.

2. The copyright notices in the Library and this entire statement, including
the above license grant, this restriction and the following disclaimer,
must be included in all copies of the Library, in whole or in part, and
all derivative works of the Library, unless such copies or derivative
works are solely in the form of machine-executable object code generated by
a source language processor. (A program that contains no derivative of any 
portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it is not a derivative work of the Library, and 
therefore falls outside the scope of this license.)
